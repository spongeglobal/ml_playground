## Playing with Data
[Live version here!](http://ml-playground.com)

ML playground is an educational sandbox for beginners learning fundamental machine learning principles from scratch, or for those who want to understand ML models from a more intuitive perspective.

We currently support 5 models - KNN, Perceptron, SVMs, neural networks, and Decision Trees. 

Feel free to contribute to the project - whether itâ€™s in terms of explanations or adding new models.
